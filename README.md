# SNOM XML Phone Book Server

A Node.js server that fetches contacts from Google and serves them as an XML phone book compatible with Snom IP phones.

## üìö Overview

This project creates a web server that:

- Authenticates with Google to access your contacts
- Converts those contacts to Snom-compatible XML format
- Serves the phone book via HTTP for Snom phones to access

## üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Google Cloud project with People API enabled
- Snom IP phone on the same network as the server

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/firsttris/snom-xml.git
cd snom-xml

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript files
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Google Cloud Project Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable the Google People API:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google People API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Create OAuth credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Set a name for your OAuth client
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback` as an authorized redirect URI
   - Click "Create"
   - Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
PORT=3000
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Server Setup

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will run on port 3000 by default (or the port specified in your .env file)

### Authentication

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/google` in your browser
2. Log in with your Google account and grant permission to access your contacts
3. You'll be redirected back to the application with a success message
4. The token will be saved locally and used for future requests

### Configure Your Snom Phone

1. Access your Snom phone's web interface
2. Navigate to Setup > Directory
3. Set the "Directory Update URL" to:
   ```
   http://[your-server-ip]:3000/phonebook.xml
   ```
4. Adjust the "Update Interval" as needed (e.g., 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
5. If your phone supports it, set the directory source to "LDAP/Server"
6. Save and apply the settings
